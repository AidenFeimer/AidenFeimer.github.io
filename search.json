    "text": "Once again, the Ravens are the favorite to win the Super Bowl in 2026. This is not the first time the Ravens have been favorites to win the Super Bowl while Lamar Jackson has been in the NFL. They continue to have some of the best talent in the league, followed by an amazing regular season.\nLamar has won two MVPs and was runner-up for his 3rd MVP this past season. He has to follow up his success with at least one Super Bowl… right?\nWrong, year after year, the Ravens fall short in the postseason. Let’s take a look at what causes these postseason meltdowns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaltimore has won the second-most regular-season games since Lamar Jackson joined the league in 2018. That’s even after Lamar went down with season-ending injuries halfway through the season in both 2021 and 2022.\nNobody questions what Lamar and the Ravens have been able to accomplish in the regular season. Finishing with more than 10 wins six of the seven seasons under Jackson.\nIt’s the postseason that Jackson can’t seem to get his team through.\nIs that what happens when you play at the same time as the Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs’ dynasty? Or are the Ravens beating themselves?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ravens’ offense has been one of the best in the regular season over Lamar Jackson’s career. The offense has been consistent over the years, while the defense has had its ups and downs.\nThere are slight decreases in points scored and touchdowns from the regular season to postseason. Where you see the biggest differential is turnovers.\nThe Ravens have the second most postseason turnovers in the league over Lamar’s career, only the Chiefs have more, with 2 more than the Ravens. That isn’t fair to Kansas City, because the Chiefs have played in 12 more games than Baltimore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems like turnovers in the playoffs are the Ravens’ problem. Taking a closer look at turnovers, you can see that out of the top 10 teams with the most playoff games played over the past seven seasons, the two teams with the worst winning percentage are the bottom two teams in turning the ball over and forcing turnovers.\nIt is not a coincidence that giving your opponent extra possessions leads to losing games. The majority of the teams that have had success in the playoffs over the past eight seasons are keeping it close to one turnover per game, while the Ravens are nearly doubling that.\nThe real question is, why is there such a big discrepancy between the regular season and post season? Is it the quarterback play of Lamar Jackson? Could it be the coaching and lack of preparation?\nLamar Jackson has had too much success in the regular season to not win a Super Bowl. If the Ravens can’t get over the hump, how will it affect Lamar Jackson’s legacy in the future?\nThe Ravens have many more seasons with Lamar at quarterback. Only time will tell if Lamar will join the greats as a Super Bowl Champion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ravens struggle in the playoffs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnfl\n\n\nfootball\n\n\nbaltimore\n\n\nravens\n\n\nplayoffs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 1, 2025\n\n\nAiden Feimer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
