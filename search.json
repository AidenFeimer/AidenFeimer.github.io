Did players stop trying on defense or are the players too hard to defend now?\nUntil a time machine is built and we can send current players back to play against former legends, we will have to look at stats to try and predict if defenses in the 80s and 90s were as good as people say.\nThe NBA has transformed since the 90s. Offenses are shooting more threes than every, players like Stephen Curry, James Harden, Ray Allen, and Klay Thompson have been some of the biggest names to shoot the three well.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nnba_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  season = c(\"1985-86\", \"1986-87\", \"1987-88\", \"1988-89\", \"1989-90\", \n             \"1990-91\", \"1991-92\", \"1992-93\", \"1993-94\", \"1994-95\", \n             \"1995-96\", \"1996-97\", \"1997-98\", \"1998-99\", \"1999-00\", \n             \"2000-01\", \"2001-02\", \"2002-03\", \"2003-04\", \"2004-05\", \n             \"2005-06\", \"2006-07\", \"2007-08\", \"2008-09\", \"2009-10\", \n             \"2010-11\", \"2011-12\", \"2012-13\", \"2013-14\", \"2014-15\", \n             \"2015-16\", \"2016-17\", \"2017-18\", \"2018-19\", \"2019-20\", \n             \"2020-21\", \"2021-22\", \"2022-23\", \"2023-24\", \"2024-25\"),\n  offense = c(111.3, 113.6, 113.4, 113.8, 112.0, \n              112.6, 113.5, 111.3, 109.7, 113.1, \n              113.2, 112.4, 110.9, 106.6, 106.8, \n              107.0, 110.3, 109.3, 110.4, 112.7, \n              110.2, 112.9, 112.1, 112.4, 113.9, \n              110.2, 110.0, 111.4, 111.3, 111.6, \n              113.5, 114.8, 114.1, 115.0, 115.9, \n              117.3, 116.2, 118.6, 122.2, 121.0),\n  defense = c(101.1, 102.2, 101.6, 100.0, 102.9, \n              101.8, 102.6, 98.2, 96.7, 102.3, \n              101.3, 99.2, 97.5, 93.6, 96.4, \n              96.6, 98.1, 96.6, 93.1, 97.8, \n              98.7, 98.8, 98.1, 101.3, 101.9, \n              99.5, 97.5, 99.0, 98.9, 100.4, \n              98.2, 102.9, 103.0, 104.9, 102.5, \n              106.8, 106.2, 109.9, 108.4, 106.6),\n  league_avg = c(107.2, 108.3, 108.0, 107.8, 108.1,\n                 107.9, 108.2, 108.0, 106.3, 108.3,\n                 107.6, 106.7, 105.0, 102.2, 104.1,\n                 103.0, 104.5, 103.6, 102.9, 106.1,\n                 106.2, 106.5, 107.5, 108.3, 107.6,\n                 107.3, 104.6, 105.8, 106.6, 105.6,\n                 106.4, 108.8, 108.6, 110.4, 110.6,\n                 112.3, 112.0, 114.8, 115.3, 114.5)\n)\nmy_caption &lt;- \"basketball-reference  |  By: Aiden Feimer\"\nnba_data$season &lt;- factor(nba_data$season, levels = nba_data$season)\nnba_data_long &lt;- nba_data %&gt;%\n  select(season, offense, defense, league_avg) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\"offense\", \"defense\", \"league_avg\"), \n               names_to = \"efficiency_type\", \n               values_to = \"rating\")\nggplot(nba_data_long, aes(x = season, y = rating, group = efficiency_type, color = efficiency_type)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"offense\" = \"#1d428a\", \"defense\" = \"#c8102e\", \"league_avg\" = \"#f58246\"),\n                    labels = c(\"offense\" = \"Best Team Offensive Rating\", \n                               \"defense\" = \"Best Team Defensive Rating\", \n                               \"league_avg\" = \"League Average\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Have Analytics Ruined The NBA?\",\n       subtitle = \"The NBA Has Turned Into An Analytical Game, Leading To The Best Offenses Ever\",\n       x = \"Season\",\n       y = \"Efficiency Rating\",\n       color = \"Metric\",\n       caption = my_caption) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, size = 8),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 8)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NBA saw some of the best defensive efficiency in the 90s through mid 2000s.This era was talked about as the best defensive era in NBA history.

The pace slowly dropped to it’s lowest ever in the 2000s. With the three pointer popularized in the early 2010s the pace picked up.\nIt turned into finding the first open guy to get a shot up from three. With faster possessions and the shot selection favoring a shot that got you more points than inside the three-point line, the game saw more scoring than ever before.\n\n\nCode\nseasons &lt;- c(\"1984-85\", \"1985-86\", \"1986-87\", \"1987-88\", \"1988-89\", \"1989-90\", \n             \"1990-91\", \"1991-92\", \"1992-93\", \"1993-94\", \"1994-95\", \"1995-96\", \n             \"1996-97\", \"1997-98\", \"1998-99\", \"1999-00\", \"2000-01\", \"2001-02\", \n             \"2002-03\", \"2003-04\", \"2004-05\", \"2005-06\", \"2006-07\", \"2007-08\", \n             \"2008-09\", \"2009-10\", \"2010-11\", \"2011-12\", \"2012-13\", \"2013-14\", \n             \"2014-15\", \"2015-16\", \"2016-17\", \"2017-18\", \"2018-19\", \"2019-20\", \n             \"2020-21\", \"2021-22\", \"2022-23\", \"2023-24\", \"2024-25\")\npace &lt;- c(102.1, 102.1, 100.8, 99.6, 100.6, 98.3, 97.8, 96.6, 96.8, 95.1, \n          92.9, 91.8, 90.1, 90.3, 88.9, 93.1, 91.3, 90.7, 91.0, 90.1, \n          90.9, 90.5, 91.9, 92.4, 91.7, 92.7, 92.1, 91.3, 92.0, 93.9, \n          93.9, 95.8, 96.4, 97.3, 100.0, 100.3, 99.2, 98.2, 99.2, 98.5, 98.8)\nppp &lt;- c(1.085, 1.079, 1.090, 1.086, 1.085, 1.089, 1.087, 1.090, 1.088, 1.067, \n         1.092, 1.084, 1.075, 1.059, 1.030, 1.047, 1.038, 1.053, 1.045, 1.037, \n         1.069, 1.072, 1.074, 1.081, 1.091, 1.083, 1.081, 1.055, 1.066, 1.076, \n         1.065, 1.072, 1.095, 1.093, 1.112, 1.115, 1.130, 1.126, 1.156, 1.159, 1.152)\nnba_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  Season = seasons,\n  Pace = pace,\n  PPP = ppp\n)\nnba_data$Decade &lt;- substr(nba_data$Season, 1, 3)\nnba_data$Decade[nba_data$Decade == \"198\"] &lt;- \"1980s\"\nnba_data$Decade[nba_data$Decade == \"199\"] &lt;- \"1990s\"\nnba_data$Decade[nba_data$Decade == \"200\"] &lt;- \"2000s\"\nnba_data$Decade[nba_data$Decade == \"201\"] &lt;- \"2010s\"\nnba_data$Decade[nba_data$Decade == \"202\"] &lt;- \"2020s\"\nnba_data$Decade &lt;- factor(nba_data$Decade, \n                         levels = c(\"1980s\", \"1990s\", \"2000s\", \"2010s\", \"2020s\"))\nseasons_to_label &lt;- nba_data %&gt;%\n  filter(Season %in% c(\"1998-99\", \"2023-24\"))\ncustom_colors &lt;- c(\n  \"1980s\" = \"#1d428a\",  # Blue\n  \"1990s\" = \"#c8102e\",  # Red\n  \"2000s\" = \"#f58246\",  # Orange\n  \"2010s\" = \"#666666\",  # Gray\n  \"2020s\" = \"#06402b\"   # Green\n)\nmy_caption &lt;- \"basketball-reference  |  By: Aiden Feimer\"\nggplot(nba_data, aes(x = Pace, y = PPP)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Decade), size = 4, alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = custom_colors, name = \"Decade\") +\n  geom_text(data = seasons_to_label, \n            aes(label = Season), \n            hjust = -0.3, \n            vjust = 0.5,\n            size = 3.5,\n            fontface = \"bold\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Pre-2000 Defenses Wouldn't Be Able To Handle Today's Offenses\",\n    subtitle = \"Teams Today Are Too Efficient For Early NBA Defenses\",\n    x = \"Pace (Possessions per 48 minutes)\",\n    y = \"Points Per Possession\",\n    caption = my_caption\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 11),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 11),\n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 8)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like the analytic looks at the game is paying off. The offenses are more efficient than ever in the 2020s. The 90s and 2000s saw the lowest pace of play and the lowest points per possession on average. Was this great defense, or was it slower offense and more twos?\nIt’s unfair to say that today’s game has less defense played than the 90s according to stats. Defenses in the 90s could focus on guarding the paint while not having as big of a threat from outside the line.\nIn today’s game every player on the court knows how to shoot the three. This spreads out the defense leaving more open space for the already elite NBA players to work with.\nCould a pre-2000 defense guard a high scoring offense in today’s game?"
